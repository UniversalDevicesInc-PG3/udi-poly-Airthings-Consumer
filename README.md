# Polyglot V3 Airthings Nodeserver

## Important Notices

I am not responsible for any issues related to this nodeserver.

## Help

If you have any issues are questions you can ask on [PG3 AirThings-C SubForum](https://forum.universal-devices.com/forum/385-airthings-c/) or report an issue at [PG3 Airthings Consumer Github issues](https://github.com/UniversalDevicesInc-PG3/udi-poly-Airthings-Consumer/issues).

## Installation

Install from the Polyglot store.

### Configuration

Open the Configuration Page for the Nodeserver in the Polyglot UI and view the [Configuration Help](/CONFIG.md) available on that page.

## Requirements

This supports consumer devices from <a href="https://www.airthings.com/">Airthings</a>.  It has only been tested with a Wave Plus device, but is currently built in a generic way to support any sensor.  But, if that sensor doesn't support everything the Wave Plus does then you will see those drivers with empty values.  I will work on resolving this withough requiring customizing the interface for each device.
