# Polyglot V3 Airthings Nodeserver

## Important Notices

I am not responsible for any issues related to this nodeserver.

## Help

If you have any issues are questions you can ask on [PG3 AirThings-C SubForum](https://forum.universal-devices.com/forum/385-airthings-c/) or report an issue at [PG3 Airthings Consumer Github issues](https://github.com/UniversalDevicesInc-PG3/udi-poly-Airthings-Consumer/issues).

## Installation

Install from the Polyglot store.

### Configuration

Open the Configuration Page for the Nodeserver in the Polyglot UI and view the [Configuration Help](/CONFIG.md) available on that page.

## Requirements

This supports consumer devices from <a href="https://www.airthings.com/">Airthings</a>.  It has only been tested with a Wave Plus device, but is currently built in a generic way to support any sensor.  But, if that sensor doesn't support everything the Wave Plus does then you will see those drivers with empty values.  I will work on resolving this withough requiring customizing the interface for each device.

## Using this Node Server

### General notes

### Nodes

#### Controller

This has the following status:
- NodeServer Online
  - Nodeserver up and running, this is managed by PG3 and will be Disconnected, Connected, or Failed
- Authroized
  - If the Authorization to the Airthings Servics is currently valid
- Server Status
  - If the last connection to Airthing Server was successful, if there is a communcation problem to their service this will go False, or one of the other known error values, and when service is restored it will go back to True.
- Sensors
  - The number of Airthings devices

#### Sensor Node

This node has the following status

| Name                | Driver  | Description
| ------------------* | ------* | -----------------------------* |
| Active              | ST      | The device is currently active |
| Battery Level       | BATLVL  | The battery level percentage |
| C02 Level           | CO2LVL  | The CO2 level |
| Humidity            | CLIHUM  | The Humidity level |
| Barometric Pressure | BARPRES | The Barometric Pressure |
| Radon               | GV1     | The Radon level |
| RSSI                | GV3     | The RSSI level |
| Temperature         | CLITEMP | The Temperature |
| Time                | GV2     | The time of device measurment, epoch value which is not currently useful in the ISY except to watch it change |
| VOC                 | GV4     | The VOC measurement |
| Voc Level           | VOCLVL  | The text description of the VOC |

## Using the Nodeserver

Following are examples have usages for this nodeserver.

### Notifications

TBD, update to this nodeservers drivers...

To include any information about a Sensor in a notification you can use any if these drivers:
```
Sensor: ${sys.node.n004_s_2930020110.name}
 Active:              ${sys.node.n004_s_2930020110.ST}
 Battery:             ${sys.node.n004_s_2930020110.BATLVL}
 Temperature:         ${sys.node.n004_s_2930020110.CLITEMP}
 ...
```
and of course if the notificaiton is triggered by a program from a change in the sensor just replace 'n004_s_2930020110' with '#'.
