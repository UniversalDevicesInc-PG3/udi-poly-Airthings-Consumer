## Short Poll

The API is limited to 120 requests per hour as documented on the <a href="https://developer.airthings.com/docs/api-rate-limit-consumer/">Airthings Rate Limit</a>. The short poll time is set 60 seconds which will be ok if you have 1 or 2 sensors, but you have more then you must increase it to 30 x number of sensors.  IF you change the value then you must restart the node server.

## Long Poll

A heartbeat is sent on each long poll.  TODO: Add link to monitoring heartbeat

## Custom Params

You must create a client on the <a href="https://dashboard.airthings.com/integrations/api-integration">Airthings API Integration</a>  Name it whatever you want and make sure to check the box next to "read:device:current_values".  The only option for Flow Type on consumer products is machine-to-machine.
